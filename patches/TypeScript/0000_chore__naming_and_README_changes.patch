-[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) is a language for application-scale JavaScript. TypeScript adds optional types to JavaScript that support tools for large-scale JavaScript applications for any browser, for any host, on any OS. TypeScript compiles to readable, standards-based JavaScript. Try it out at the [playground](https://www.typescriptlang.org/play/), and stay up to date via [our blog](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/typescript) and [Twitter account](https://twitter.com/typescript).

+[TSP](https://github.com/bcheidemann/TSP) is a fork and partial superset of the [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
+programming language which aims to implement features incompatible with the [design goals](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/wiki/TypeScript-Design-Goals)
+of TypeScript. This includes breaking change upgrades to legacy features such as enums, as well as maintaining support
+for valuable language features TypeScript has dropped support for, such as design time type reflection in EcmaScript
+decorators.

-## Contribute
+## Motivation
 
-There are many ways to [contribute](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) to TypeScript.
-* [Submit bugs](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues) and help us verify fixes as they are checked in.
-* Review the [source code changes](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/pulls).
-* Engage with other TypeScript users and developers on [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/typescript).
-* Help each other in the [TypeScript Community Discord](https://discord.gg/typescript).
-* Join the [#typescript](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23TypeScript) discussion on Twitter.
-* [Contribute bug fixes](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).
+TypeScripts has clear [design goals](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/wiki/TypeScript-Design-Goals) which are
+intended to minimise deviation from the base JavaScript language. There's nothing wrong with these goals, but they
+prohibit the development of certain new (and we believe useful) features. The goal of TSP is not to maintain "closeness"
+with JavaScript. We believe that TypeScript offers one of the best, most flexible type systems available. This project
+aims to explore what is possible when building upon TypeScript's excellent type system, while embracing the
+opportunities afforded to us by allowing some strategic breaking changes, and implementing a more expressive syntax
+which is not bound by the TypeScript design goals.

+## Contribute
 
-## Documentation
+TSP aims to remain up to date with the latest TypeScript features. As such, if your contribution is not specific to TSP,
+it should be made in the upstream [TypeScript repo](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript#contribute). However, if
+you're interested in contributing to TSP, feel free to open a pull request, or for larger features requiring
+discussion, please open an issue.

 ## Roadmap
 
-For details on our planned features and future direction, please refer to our [roadmap](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/wiki/Roadmap).
+We are currently working on implementing foundational infrastructure, such as patch management and publishing workflows.
+For now, there is no roadmap for the development of specific features.
